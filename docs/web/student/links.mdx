# Links

A link is a bookmark for a website that can be opened from the Subjective dashboard.

When you set up Subjective with an existing school, you'll have some default links. These links can be removed, and you can even add your own.

### Desktop

You'll find it on the right hand side of the 'Home' page on desktop.

### Mobile

Or for mobile users, in the carousel of your 'Home' page.

:::info[Carousel]
For mobile users, a carousel puts sections such as links on pages accessible through a swipe.
Try swiping left and right, between pages to check out the carousel sections.
