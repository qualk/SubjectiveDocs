:::info[Privacy]

We take your privacy seriously. Your data is for your eyes only.

**We may ask to access your location.** Your location is used to show schools in your area. Your location data is completely private, and inaccessible to us.

**We may ask for notification access on setup.** We use notifications to notify you of bell times and the end of your classes.
