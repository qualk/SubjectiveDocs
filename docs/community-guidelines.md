# Guidelines
We aim to make Subjective Community a space for our students to interact, suggest new features and stay up to date on Subjective.
Safety is our number one priority.

## Verification

By verifying in the community, you agree to our Subjective community guidelines. Community guidelines are subject to change with notification.

## Behaviour
Treat everyone with respect.
Explicit and derogatory behaviour, harrassment, and spam has no place in our community, and it isn't the place for self-promotion or advertising.

Violations of these rules will be reviewed on a case by case basis.

## Safety
*Help keep our community safe. Report any issues to communitysafety@subjective.school or by creating a ticket in Subjective Community.*
