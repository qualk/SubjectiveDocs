# The `sj` CLI and the `subjective` Library

[`sj`](https://github.com/SubjectiveLabs/sj) is a command-line interface (CLI) for students to organise and manage their timetables and subjects. Intended as a companion to the more user-friendly interface of other Subjective apps, it serves as a fast and powerful tool for developers.

The CLI uses the backend library `subjective` to perform its operations. This library is also available for use by developers to create their own apps to interact with Subjective data.
